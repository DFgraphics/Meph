I present to your attention incomplete 32x32 graphical tileset, that contains sprites only for dwarves. It is understood that it will be used in conjunction with ☼Meph Tileset☼ (or 32x tileset, which as I understand and hope, is drawn by Obsidian Soul).

For the pattern, I took the sprite of dwarf from ☼Meph Tileset☼(initially drew Obsidian Soul) and greatly redesigned it.

I immediately say that things as a barrel of beer,a bag of flour, an anvil or other in the hands of dwarf will not be drawn unnecessarily, because it looks stupid and as experience has shown, there is no clarity in identifying the profession of a particular dwarf. Of course, some tools will be painted, but within reason.
