# Meph+Vordak (lite)

This is a vanilla-compatible release of Meph's 32x32 Tileset  
with enhancements from Vordak's add-on pack applied to it.  
This release excludes Meph's decorative workshops features.  
If you would like to download the full version of Meph 32x with  
all the features, you can get it from its thread on bay12forums.

Meph's forum thread: www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=161047.0

Then you can install a compatible version of Vordak's add-on pack  
over Meph's tileset yourself. You can get it from Vordak's thread.

I present to your attention incomplete 32x32 graphical tileset, that contains sprites only for dwarves. It is understood that it will be used in conjunction with ☼Meph Tileset☼ (or 32x tileset, which as I understand and hope, is drawn by Obsidian Soul).

For the pattern, I took the sprite of dwarf from ☼Meph Tileset☼(initially drew Obsidian Soul) and greatly redesigned it.

I immediately say that things as a barrel of beer,a bag of flour, an anvil or other in the hands of dwarf will not be drawn unnecessarily, because it looks stupid and as experience has shown, there is no clarity in identifying the profession of a particular dwarf. Of course, some tools will be painted, but within reason.
